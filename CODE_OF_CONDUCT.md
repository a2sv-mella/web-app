## Naming Variables

1. Use meaningful and descriptive names.
2. Follow the camelCase naming convention for variables and functions.
3. Constants should be in ALL_CAPS.
4. Avoid using single-character names, except for loop indices.

## Comment Rules

1. Write comments for complex code blocks.
2. Avoid obvious comments.
3. Keep your comments concise.

## Spacing and Formatting

1. Use spaces around operators and after commas.
2. Use indentation to make the code more readable.
3. Follow the brace style of the existing code (e.g., K&R, Allman, etc.).
4. Keep line length under 80 characters when possible.

## Commit Message Rules

1. Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
2. Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
3. Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
4. Add descriptive emojis before your commit messages. ("âž• Add feature" not "Add feature").

## Branch Naming Rules

1. Use descriptive and concise names for branches.
2. Prefix branch names with the type of work (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, `release/`).
3. Use dashes to separate words.

## Conventional Rules

1. Do not commit code that you didn't write yourself without proper attribution.
2. Do not remove code comments that provide context to the code.
3. Test your code before committing to avoid breaking the build.
4. Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
