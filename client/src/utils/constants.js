If you have not received an email within a few minutes, make sure it is the correct address. Look in your junk mail or spam folder to see if your confirmation email was delivered to that folder instead of your email inbox.",

      "Mella's dashboard enables a user interface for you to operate and customize your account. It has been organized in a manner that is the best ideal for productivity. The Dashboard can be used to manage your payments and refunds, handle disputes and more. It can also be used to perform specific actions, such as cancelling a subscription without needing the API — making the dashboard useful when running a business. Home provides information on the performance of the business offering an in-depth insight on your activities. As it uses a wide range of analytics, any activity that may require you to take a quick action, such as identification verification, will be shown in Home.",
